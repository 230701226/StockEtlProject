# Data Pipeline & Visualization using Python
üìä StockETL ‚Äì Internship Task Documentation
COMPANY: CodTech IT Solutions
NAME: Pooja A K
DOMAIN: Data Science
DURATION: 4 Weeks
MENTOR: Neela Santosh

DESCRIPTION OF TASK
I developed a fully automated StockETL Data Pipeline and deployed a visual dashboard using Streamlit, focused on processing and analyzing historical stock data for multiple companies.

The project automates the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for over 30 stock tickers, generating meaningful financial metrics and interactive visualizations.

Key capabilities include:

Batch-wise ingestion of raw CSV files (one per stock)
 Preprocessing: date parsing, handling missing values, and feature engineering (returns, volatility)
 Statistical feature scaling (StandardScaler)
 Export to clean, processed dataset (processed_data.csv)
 Insight generation: trend lines, volatility, and rolling averages
 Deployment of full dashboard via Streamlit.io

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Tool	Purpose
Python	Core programming and logic
pandas	Reading, preprocessing, and aggregation
scikit-learn	Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
matplotlib	Data visualization for trends and patterns
Streamlit	Building and deploying interactive dashboard

DEPLOYMENT METHODS
Local ETL Execution (Python Script)
Tested and executed via:

bash
Copy
Edit
python run_pipeline.py
Reads raw stock CSVs from /data

Generates processed_data.csv in /output

Stores logs in etl_log.txt

Supports over 15,000 rows of processed stock data

Shows summary stats in summary.md

üåê Online Deployment via Streamlit.io
Live dashboard hosted on:
üîó StockETL Dashboard ‚Äì Hugging Face Spaces

Features include:

 Upload and explore processed stock data

 Dynamic visualizations: price trends, volume distribution, returns

 Ticker-wise filtering, timeline selection

 Time-series plots using matplotlib

 Download processed output

‚ö† Note: Only online deployment via Streamlit.io was used. Offline deployment via Docker was explored but not submitted due to time constraints.
